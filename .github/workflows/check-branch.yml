# NOTE: @chapati23 disabled this check today on 18.02.2025 as a conscious tradeoff to prioritize simpler and faster delivery
# over a slower release cycle with more checks. We can turn it back on if we notice that we have more production issues but
# for the moment we don't have a lot of users on this DApp so should prioritize faster improvements until we reach greater scale.
